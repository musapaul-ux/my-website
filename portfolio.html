		<h2>Welcome to my porfolio page</h2>
		<h3>My first project</h3>
		<p>In this project, I developed a <strong>Rentals managing system</strong> that helps enhance tenants in booking for rooms online and helps import efficiency.
		The application supports the following basic operations
			<ul>
				<li>Displaying available rooms</li>
				<li>Displaying Room sizes</li>
				<li>Displaying there Prices</li>
				<li>Collect tenants details</li>
				<li>Allows customers to place their bookings</li>
				<li>Calculate the total bill </li>
				<li>Displays a successfuly message when order is placed</li>
			
			</ul>
		<br>This application was entirely developed in Java, though I can also work with different other programming languages like;
		<ul>
			<li>C++</li>
			<li>Python</li>
			<li>C</li>
			<li>HTML</li>
		</ul>

		<br>The idea of this project came to the challenges in the Banking systems in several banks. After a through research, I found out that, most of the banks 
		face a problem of long lines at the ATM teller. DEveloping this application will enable users of these banks to transact at ease without the unnecessary 
		long waiting lines.
