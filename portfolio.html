		<h2>Welcome to my porfolio page</h2>
		<h3>My first project</h3>
		<p>In this project, I developed a <strong>simple banking application</strong> that helps enhance banking activities and helps import efficiency.<br>
		The application supports the following basic operations
			<ul>
				<li>Checking acccount balance</li>
				<li>Depositing money</li>
				<li>withdrawing money</li>
			</ul>
		<br>This application was entirely developed in C++, though I can also work with different other programming languages like;
		<ul>
			<li>java</li>
			<li>Python</li>
			<li>C</li>
		</ul>
		<br>The idea of this project came to the challenges in the Banking systems in several banks. After a through research, I found out that, most of the banks 
		face a problem of long lines at the ATM teller. DEveloping this application will enable users of these banks to transact at ease without the unnecessary 
		long waiting lines.
